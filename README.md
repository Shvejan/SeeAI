Introducing SeeAI - the revolutionary AI-powered smart sunglasses designed to enhance accessibility for the visually impaired.

## Features

SeeAI is powered by Hugging Face transformers and a state-of-the-art facial recognition system. It is capable of giving the user a completely hands-free experience helping them understand the world better through audio-based instructions. 

Some of the key features of SeeAI are:

- Facial recognition: SeeAI is equipped with DeepFace, one of the best facial recognition models in the market. It can identify, remember (registering a new face), and recognize people (detecting unknown face detected and calling 911).
- Traffic mode: SeeAI can help the visually impaired cross the road. With the Hugging Face vision transformer, the model can recognize various traffic signs like walk-sign, wait-sign, etc. and guide the user to take action accordingly.
- Video call assistance: If the user is not confident with the instructions that the model is giving or if they require additional assistance, SeeAI's innovative design allows the user to easily make a video call to someone simply by long-pressing the button on the glasses. A live video will be streamed to another person, who can give live instructions through the call.
